# State Management

## States

- **courses**: This state variable holds an array of available courses. It is initialized by fetching data from a JSON file using the `fetch` API. Any updates to this state trigger a re-render to reflect changes in the available courses.

- **selectedItems**: This state variable is an array that keeps track of the courses selected by the user. When a course is added to the cart, it is pushed into this array, and when removed, it is filtered out. This state allows for real-time updates to the cart.

- **creditTime**: This state variable represents the total credit time of the selected courses. It is updated each time a course is added or removed from the cart. There is also a credit limit check to ensure that the total credit time does not exceed 20 credits.

- **totalPrice**: This state variable keeps track of the total price of the selected courses in the cart. Similar to `creditTime`, it is updated whenever a course is added or removed from the cart.

## Functions

- **addToCart(obj)**: This function is responsible for adding a selected course to the cart. It updates `selectedItems`, `totalPrice`, and `creditTime`. If the credit limit is exceeded, it displays an error message using toast notifications.

- **removeFromCart(obj)**: This function allows users to remove a course from the cart. It updates `selectedItems`, `totalPrice`, and `creditTime`. It also displays a success message through toast notifications.

## Use of useEffect

The `useEffect` hook is utilized to fetch the course data from the `data.json` file when the component mounts. It ensures that the `courses` state is populated with data from the JSON file only once.
